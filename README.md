This repository is used to store custom modules created for FHS.

For fhs_acct_sign_up_extension module, don't forget that you need to create two 'File' fields under the Contacts App:
'Contractor Doc' and 'Fiscal Doc'

The required_fields_indicator module highlights what fields are required on the Sign Up page.

The login_as_any_user allows you to log-in as any user as the name implies.
